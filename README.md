# ailot_converter

A command-line application to convert [Toolbox](http://www-01.sil.org/computing/toolbox/) text files to JSON for use with the [Ailot mobile dictionary](https://github.com/phonemica/ailot). This is a preliminary version just to get the job done. User-friendliness and the ability to set custom fields will be added shortly.
